# This file is an example of a custom transcription export template
# Keep in mind that it might be outdated, so please refer to the latest documentation
# Also, we don't recommend using this file directly, since it might be overwritten by the application on future updates
# Since this is a YAML file, make sure you don't change the indentation or the structure of the file
# If any errors occur during export, use a YAML validator to check the file for errors
name: Custom Example

# The file extension to use for the exported file (used when auto-exporting)
extension: txt

# This is the header of the file
# Variables are defined using {variable_name} - see the curly braces
# Below you can see the variables that are currently available.
# You can also use these variables in the segment template below
header: |
  This should appear in the header of the file
  You can use any of these variables:
  
  Transcription name: {transcription_name}
  Transcription path: {transcription_file_path}
  Source file path: {source_file_path}
  Timeline name: {transcription_timeline_name}
  Timeline frame rate: {transcription_timeline_fps}
  Timeline start timecode: {transcription_start_tc}
  Main language: {transcription_language}
  Transcription Last modified: {transcription_last_save_time}

# This is the segment template
# For each segment in the transcription, the tool will use this template to export it in the final file
# Variables are defined using {variable_name} - see the curly braces
# Below you can see the variables that are currently available for segments
# In addition, you can also use any of the variables from the header
segment_template: |
  Segment index: {segment_index}
  Segment times: {segment_start} --> {segment_end}
  Segment times in timecode: {segment_start_tc} --> {segment_end_tc}
  Segment time in frames: {segment_start_frame} --> {segment_end_frame}
  Segment text: {segment_text}
  Segment speaker: {segment_speaker_name}

# The segment separator is used to separate each segment in the final file
# You can use any of the variables from the header and the segment template
segment_separator: "\n\n"

# You can define multiple conditions to filter out segments
# You can use any of the segment variables mentioned above in the condition and the export function will evaluate it
# For e.g. if you want to filter out segments that have a specific speaker,
# you can write: '{segment_speaker_name}' == 'Speaker 1'
#  - this will only export segments that have 'Speaker 1' as the speaker
#  (make sure you use the single quotes around the variable and the value)
#
# Or, if you don't want to export meta segments, you can write: not {segment_meta}
# Below is an example of how this might work
segment_condition: |
  not {segment_meta}
  not {segment_meta_speaker}
  not {segment_meta_other}
  '{segment_speaker_name}' == 'Speaker 1'

# The footer is the last part of the file
# You can use any of the variables from the header as well
footer: |
  This should appear in the footer of the file
